Attention heads are parallel “mini-attention modules” inside a transformer layer.
Each head focuses on different relationships in the sentence.

In a transformer, 
    attention decides how much each token should pay attention to every other token.

But a single head can only capture one type of relationship.
So transformers use multiple heads, each learning a different kind of pattern.


INTUITIVE EXAMPLE:

“Cat and dog sat on the mat.”

One attention head may focus on:
	•	subject → verb (cat → sat, dog → sat)

Another head may focus on:
	•	animal → location (cat → mat, dog → mat)

Another head may focus on:
	•	adjacent words (“sat” → “on” → “the”)

Another head may focus on:
	•	long-range dependencies

Each head captures a different aspect.


NOTE: 
    Q: More the heads in a transformer layer, better the results?
    A: More heads help only until the model has enough capacity to learn diverse relationships. 
       Beyond that point, extra heads add cost but don’t improve results.

 How a head works (internally)

For each head, the model computes:
	•	Q (query)
	•	K (key)
	•	V (value)

All derived from the input embeddings.

FORMULA:
    Attention scores = softmax(Q × Kᵀ)
    Output = Attention scores × V

Each attention head learns 3 projection matrices:
    Wq, Wk, Wv

For each token:
    Q = e × Wq
    K = e × Wk
    V = e × Wv

So for all tokens you get:
    Q = [Q1, Q2, Q3, ...]
    K = [K1, K2, K3, ...]
    V = [V1, V2, V3, ...]

Compute Attention Scores:
    For one token (say token i):
        score(i, j) = (Qi · Kj) / sqrt(d)
    Do this for all j (all tokens).

    Then apply softmax:
        weights(i, :) = softmax(scores(i, :))
    
    Weighted Sum of V:
        output_i = Σ_j  weights(i, j) × Vj

 Multi-Head Attention:
    Each head does the above in ** parallel **:
        Head 1 → output₁
        Head 2 → output₂
        Head 3 → output₃
        ...
        Head h → outputₕ

    Combined = [output₁ || output₂ || ... || outputₕ]

    Final = Combined × Wout
